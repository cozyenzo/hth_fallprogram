# Step 1: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between the following features: survival, pclass, sex, age, and fare 
corr_heatmap = 

# Step 2: Create a bar graph that illustrates how many passengers fell into each of these age ranges: 0 - 16, 17 - 25, 26 -40, 41 - 59, 60 or older
age_group_chart = 

# Step 3: Create a line graph showing the average survival percentage of each of the previous age groups
survival_age_pers = 

# Step 4: Create a pie chart that shows the percentage of survivors that were male and the percentage of survivors that were female
survivors = 

# Step 5: Create a histogram that shows the distribution of passengers between the three embarking locations: C (Cherbourg), Q (Queenstown), S (Southampton)
