I was interested in this data set because I am a fan of Pokemon and have been since I can remmeber. Competitive battling was always something that I was interested in but never got the chance to dabble in. With this data set you can see all of the types and stats of each Pokemon which is extremely useful when doing competitive battling. Some questions that I had were: 
1) Which Pokemon is objectively the best?
2) Which Pokemon has the greatest Attack?
3) Which Pokemon has the greatest Defense?
4) Which Pokemon has the greatest Special Attack?
5) What are the best Legendary Pokemnon?
6) What are the best non-legendary Pokemon?
7) What is the best Water type Pokemon?
8) What team would be the most well-rouned team stat wise?
9) Which Pokemon type is the weakest?
10) Which is the strongest?
11) Is there a correlation between a Pokemon having a high attack and defense?
12) Is there a correlation between a Pokemon with high defense and HP?
